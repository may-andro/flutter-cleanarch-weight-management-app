This would take time and money. Fortunately, you can also get an estimate of your body fat with only a scale and a tape measure. It may not be as accurate as tests done in a clinical setting, but it can help you determine if you are within a healthy range or if you need to change your eating and exercise routine. When measured consistently over time, this formula will show you if you are losing or gaining body fat.",
